    		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    		<h3>Where can I buy <b>Mr. Goderfarmer's Original Root Beer</b>?</h3>
    		<p>Mr. Goderfarmer's Original Root Beer is so exclusive and #hipster that only a small amount is brewed every year. It is not available for purchase online nor in stores. In order to enjoy its great taste you need to know someone who knows someone who is best buddy with the brewmaster himself.</p>

    		<h3>So, what's the secret behind the great taste of Mr. Goderfarmer's Original Root Beer?</h3>
			<p>Well, if we published it on the internet, it wouldn't be a secret anymore now, would it? Having said that, here is a fun fact we can share: The Brewmaster of Mr. Goderfarmer's Original Root Beer had the epiphany for its great taste while undergoing a root canal treatment at the local dentist in his home town.</p>

			<h3>The bottle labels and this website are so ... basic. What's up with that?</h3>
			<p>It's not basic. It's focused. Instead of designing a fancy-schmancy bottle label we put all our energy into creating the perfect taste for our Mr. Goderfarmer's Original Root Beer. That's dedication! Nevertheless, if you feel like designing a new bottle label or website for us, send us an <a href="mailto:brewmaster@goderfarmers.com">email</a>. If we like your work we will award you with a bottle of our very own precious Mr. Goderfarmer's Original Root Beer (pick-up at our location in California required).</p>

			<h3>Will Mr. Goderfarmer's Original Root Beer turn into regular beer when poured into a squared glass?</h3>
			<p>This is not the place for jokes. Root beer is serious business.</p>
